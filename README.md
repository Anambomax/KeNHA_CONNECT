# KeNHA_Connect
KeNHA_Connect is a digital feedback and stakeholder engagement system designed for the Kenya National Highways Authority (KeNHA). It provides a central platform for users to submit feedback, report road-related issues, and track responses from KeNHA officials, fostering transparency, accountability, and citizen participation in road infrastructure management.

ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement
KeNHA manages a vast network of national highways in Kenya and interacts with a wide range of stakeholders, including citizens, contractors, staff, and government agencies. However, the current communication process is fragmented and lacks a structured, traceable, and efficient way to:

Receive and process public feedback or complaints,

Track and respond to infrastructure issues like damaged roads or signage,

Manage and analyze stakeholder input across various departments,

Provide transparency and status updates to citizens and internal users.

This lack of a centralized system limits real-time collaboration, reduces public trust, and delays issue resolution.

ðŸŽ¯ Project Scope
KeNHA_Connect aims to bridge the communication gap between the public and KeNHA by offering:

ðŸ”¹ User Registration & Role-Based Access

Admins, staff, and stakeholders can register and log in with personalized dashboards.

ðŸ”¹ Feedback Submission

Citizens can submit road complaints, suggestions, or observations including photos, GPS locations, and road categories.

ðŸ”¹ Automated Ticketing & Issue Tracking

Every report generates a unique case ID, which can be tracked and updated until resolution.

ðŸ”¹ Departmental Routing

Feedback is automatically assigned to the relevant department (e.g., Engineering, Safety, Maintenance) based on issue type.

ðŸ”¹ Response Management

KeNHA staff can respond to each submission with updates, follow-up actions, or closure remarks.

ðŸ”¹ Data Visualization

Admins can view analytics on feedback types, location heatmaps, resolution time, and department performance.
