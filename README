##KeNHA_Connect
 KeNHA faces delays and inefficiencies in handling public feedback due to lack of a centralized and transparent system.
 KeNHA_Connect solves this by enabling structured submission, assignment, and tracking of road-related incidents.
 It is a web-based platform for citizens to report issues and for staff to manage and respond with accountability.
